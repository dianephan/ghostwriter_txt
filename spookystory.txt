The following is a spooky story written for kids, just in time for Halloween. Everyone always talks about the old house at the end of the street, but I couldn’t believe what happened when I went inside.

I always thought that it was haunted, but I didn’t think that it would actually be haunted. I know that it should be a scary house, but I never thought that the monster inside would be so scary. I know that I should have known, but you can’t expect the unexpected.

The house was a scary place to start with, but the monster inside was so scary that it made the house even scarier. It was a monster that I didn’t want in my house and I didn’t want to be in the house with that kind of monster.

The monster was a scary one, but the worst part of all was that there was no way to get away from it. It was a monster that you couldn’t run from, a monster that you couldn’t hide from. It was a monster that you couldn’t even escape from.



It was a monster that was always going to be there, and a monster that you would never be able to escape from. The monster was a scary one, but the scariest part of all was how I couldn’t get away from it.

I knew that I wanted to get away from the monster, but I also knew that I couldn’t. I know that it is scary to have to live with a monster that you can’t get away from, but it is even scarier not being able to get away from a monster.

A monster that you can’t get away from is a scary one, but it is even scarier when you are in the house with that monster. I knew that I didn’t want to be in the house with that monster, but I knew that I couldn’t get away from it. I knew that I wanted to get out of the house, but I knew that I couldn’t.

The house was a scary place, and the monster inside was a scary one. The scary thing about the monster inside the house is that it is going to be there forever.

The scariest part of all is that the monster will always be in the house, and I will never be able to get out.The following is a spooky story written for kids, just in time for Halloween.
